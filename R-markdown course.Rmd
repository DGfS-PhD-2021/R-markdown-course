1. Introduction to R Markdown

Hi and welcome to the first part of today's workshop. My name is Giulia and I will first introduce you to R Markdown, and then show you how to create reports, documents and presentations with it.

R Markdown is a tool we use to create *efficient reports*, to *summarize analyses* and *communicate results* to an audience.
With R Markdown, using only R code, you can create several kinds of documents, including HTML and PDFs.
Most importantly, R Markdown ensures that the *results are reproducible*.

Consider the following scenario:

- You've conducted your analyses and created a paper draft where you demonstrate your findings.
- Then you send the paper to a journal and, after a few months, the reviewers request some modifications 
- However, let's imagine that, by then, you forgot the exact steps you went through to get to those early results, or that in the meantime you updated your data files. How are you going to do?

- By generating the results and report from code with R Markdown, you *can always reproduce your results, and easily update new data in the workflow*. 

2. R Markdown elements

An R Markdown document is made of three components: the *code*, the *text* of the report, and the *metadata* for the file.

8. R Markdown file

At the top of the file, you can see the YAML header, containing the file metadata. It is followed by the contents that make up the report, which include the code chunks and the text. In this session, we will not focus on the YAML, and we will use a basic syntax that accommodates simple reports. If you want to personalize your YAML more, several tutorials can be found online. I will provide a few links at the end of the session.

9. Knit

After we have finished modifying a file, we might want to see it in a more legible form, which can be shared with others. Knitting a file is how we generate an output file from the R markdown file.

When a file is knit, R Markdown transforms the document into the desired output file, reading the text and running the chucks of code.

For example, when the R Markdown file shown on the left is knit, it will create the output shown on the right. We'll learn more about output types later in the chapter.

10. Course overview

In this course, we'll have a look at the various elements that make up an R markdown document. Then, we'll learn how to add plots and analyses to a report, organize and improve a report, and customize a report by specifying fonts and colors.

11. Investment annual summary

Throughout the course, we'll build a report using an open source dataset of Student Exams Performance from Keggle. This contains the results of .

12. Investment services projects
The second dataset, investment services projects, displays more specific information about each investment project from the 2012 to 2018 fiscal years. Note that the fiscal year starts on July 1st of the previous year and ends on June 30th of the year of interest. Information listed includes the project name, company name, sector, project status, and investment amounts.

13. Code chunks
To get started, we'll add some code by adding a code chunk. A code chunk is a section that contains the code that will either render output in the report or display the code itself as part of the report. Chunks are what separate the text of the report from the code.

14. Adding code chunks
Code chunks start and end

15. Adding code chunks
with a set of three backticks. The first set of backticks signify the beginning of the code chunk

16. Adding code chunks
and are followed by curly braces that include the letter r, to specify that we are adding r code. Within the curly braces, we can specify a number of other chunk options. We'll be discussing the details of this later in the course.

17. Adding code chunks
In the code chunk shown, we've specified the investment annual summary dataset name in the code chunk. When we knit the file,

18. Adding code chunks
we see the dataset included in the document.

19. Let's practice!

Creating your first R Markdown file

Throughout the course, you'll be working on creating an investment report using two datasets from the World Bank IFC. The first dataset, investment_annual_summary, provides the summary of the dollars in millions provided to each region for each fiscal year, from 2012 to 2018. To get started on your report, you first want to print out the dataset.

To create your report, you'll need to edit the Markdown file shown on the right as described in the instructions, then press the green "Knit HTML" button to knit the file and see the resulting HTML file. We'll discuss other output types later in the course.

In each exercise, the first code chunk in the Markdown file will load the readr package and the datasets you'll be using in the exercise. You'll learn more about the details of this code chunk later in the course, but you won't need to modify it for any of the exercises in this chapter.Creating your first R Markdown file
