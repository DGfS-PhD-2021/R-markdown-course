1. Introduction to R Markdown

Hi and welcome to the first part of today's workshop. My name is Giulia and I will introduce you to R Markdown, and show you how to create reports and presentations with it.

R Markdown is a tool we use to create *efficient reports* to *summarize analyses* and *communicate results* to an audience.
With R Markdown, using only R code, you can create HTML and PDF documents. Most importantly, R Markdown ensures that the *results are reproducible*.

Consider the following scenario:
you've conducted your analyses and created a paper draft where you demonstrate your findings.
You send the paper to a journal and the reviewers request some modifications after a few months.
However, what if you can't remember each step you went through, or if in the meantime you updated your data files?
By generating the results and report from code with R Markdown, you, and others, *can always reproduce your results*.

2. R Markdown elements

An R Markdown document is made of three components: the code, the text of the report, and the metadata for the file.

8. R Markdown file
The YAML header containing the metadata appears at the top of the file, followed by the contents that make up the report, including the text and code in code chunks. YAML is a syntax for hierarchical data structures that is commonly used for configuration files.

9. Knit
When we finish modifying a file and are ready to see the report, we'll need to knit it. Knitting a file is how we generate an output file from the R markdown file. When a file is knit, R Markdown runs the chunks of R code contained in the file and combines them with the text in the document into an HTML file. For example, when the R Markdown file shown on the left is knit, it will create the output shown on the right. We'll learn more about output types later in the chapter.

10. Course overview
In this course, we'll cover the various elements that make up an R markdown document. Then, we'll learn how to add plots and analyses to a report, organize and improve a report, and customize a report by specifying fonts and colors that reflect a brand.

11. Investment annual summary
Throughout the course, we'll build a report using real-world datasets from the World Bank International Finance Corporation or IFC. The first dataset, investment annual summary, provides a summary of the dollars in millions provided to each region for each fiscal year, from 2012 to 2018.

12. Investment services projects
The second dataset, investment services projects, displays more specific information about each investment project from the 2012 to 2018 fiscal years. Note that the fiscal year starts on July 1st of the previous year and ends on June 30th of the year of interest. Information listed includes the project name, company name, sector, project status, and investment amounts.

13. Code chunks
To get started, we'll add some code by adding a code chunk. A code chunk is a section that contains the code that will either render output in the report or display the code itself as part of the report. Chunks are what separate the text of the report from the code.

14. Adding code chunks
Code chunks start and end

15. Adding code chunks
with a set of three backticks. The first set of backticks signify the beginning of the code chunk

16. Adding code chunks
and are followed by curly braces that include the letter r, to specify that we are adding r code. Within the curly braces, we can specify a number of other chunk options. We'll be discussing the details of this later in the course.

17. Adding code chunks
In the code chunk shown, we've specified the investment annual summary dataset name in the code chunk. When we knit the file,

we see the dataset included in the document.

19. Let's practice!

Creating your first R Markdown file

Throughout the course, you'll be working on creating an investment report using two datasets from the World Bank IFC. The first dataset, investment_annual_summary, provides the summary of the dollars in millions provided to each region for each fiscal year, from 2012 to 2018. To get started on your report, you first want to print out the dataset.

To create your report, you'll need to edit the Markdown file shown on the right as described in the instructions, then press the green "Knit HTML" button to knit the file and see the resulting HTML file. We'll discuss other output types later in the course.

In each exercise, the first code chunk in the Markdown file will load the readr package and the datasets you'll be using in the exercise. You'll learn more about the details of this code chunk later in the course, but you won't need to modify it for any of the exercises in this chapter.Creating your first R Markdown file
