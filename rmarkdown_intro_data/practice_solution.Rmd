CUSTOMISE YOUR YAML


It's your turn!

Look at the top of the window, do you see the Knit button? try and click on it.
You should either get an error or a blank output, right? Don't worry, that's supposed to happen. It is because this file does not yet have a YAML, nor a content, which means R Studio does not really know what to do with it.

Exercise:

Try and create the header above from scratch. Remember to enclose it between two sets of "---" (no spaces between the three), and to include the fields `title` `date` `author`, followed respectively by a column sign, and by your input data (i.e. the title, your name, the date).
Don't forget the most important field: the `output`. For now, use "html_document" as the output format.

Ok, know knit again.

Did it work now? Well done!

-------------------------------

THE DATE

Now that you have a nice title and your name on the report, you might want to change the way the date is displayed. Of course you can add in manually as text, especially if you want it to remain the same. However, if you want it to reflect the date in which you have modified the document, you might want to use your System date.

In this case, use the code "`r format(Sys.Date(), '%d %B %Y')`" instead. You can change the order of d, B and Y, that indicate respectively day, month and year, or even add commas between them.

Also note how this green text is formatted between arrows. This indicates that whatever text is contained here will not be printed in our output. This way you can take notes also in the text sections (within code chunks, you can add comments by adding a "#" sign before the text.)

-----------------------------

THE MAIN BODY: TEXT AND CODE


Don't worry about the chunk of code below. It can define the knitting properties.
Leave it as it is for now: we will not discuss it in depth. It is however important to understand that it defines the "rules" for your rmarkdown output.
In the chunk content, `echo = FALSE` is an parameter of the knit function that tells your markdown document to avoid printing of the R code that generates outputs for all the chunks in your document. The `message = FALSE` prevents the printing of messages related to the chunks' content.
Notice also that it says "include=FALSE" in the chunk description inside the { }, which means you will not see this specific chunk when you knit the file, even though it will be excecuted.

You can try and change them later on and see what happens!
-->
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message=F)
```



<!--

THE TEXT

Here we go! this might be the beginning of your report. As mentioned in the introductory presentation, you can organize your content hierarchically, simply using "#" sing. (yes, this same sign creates headings in the TEXT sections, and comments in the code chunks)

for instance:

# This would be your Heading 1
## This would be your Heading 2
### This would be your Heading 3
#### This would be your Heading 4
##### This would be your Heading 5

and so on.

If you want your sections to show numbers, you have to add this information to the YAML the following:

number_sections: true

However, as I mentioned before, be aware of the YAML format. In order for it to work, this is how it needs to look.

output:
  html_document:
    number_sections: true


Exercise:

Now try to insert a Heading (##) between this block of instructions and the next, as well as a short description. Then knit again and see what happens. Nice, right?

-->

# Heading

This is going to be a report about student perfromance.



<!--

BLOCKQUOTES

If you need to call special attention to a quote from another source, or design a pull quote for a magazine article, then Markdown's blockquote syntax will be useful. A blockquote is a sentence or paragraph that's been specially formatted to draw attention to the reader.

To create a block quote, all you have to do is preface a line with the "greater than" caret (>). For example:

> "In a few moments he was barefoot, his stockings folded in his pockets and his canvas shoes dangling by their knotted laces over his shoulders and, picking a pointed salt-eaten stick out of the jetsam among the rocks, he clambered down the slope of the breakwater."

You can increase the level of the quote by increasing the number of > symbols.

Exercise:

Add below a quote you like that will suit the beginning of your report and format it as a blockquote.
By inserting it below, it should naturally be printed after the description you wrote before.

IMAGES

There might be times when you simply want to insert an image in your report.
To do that, you just have to remember the structure ![]()

The square bracket contains your description for the image, and the parenthesis the link to either a local image (in which case you have to have it somewhere in your computer) or to an image online.

One more thing you might be wondering "how do I tell RStudio to center the image in the page?"
There are two ways to achieve this:

Markdown basic syntax: 

- central alignment = enclose the whole image code between <center> and </center> 

  i.e. <center>
       ![your caption](your link)
       </center>

- right and left alignment = enclose the whole image code between
  <p align='right'> or <p align='left'> and </p>
  
  i.e. <p align='right'>
       ![your caption](your link)
       </p>

To specify the size of your image, you can add a {} right after the (image link)
  
  ![your caption](your link){width=800}


Exercise:

As an extra funky opening for your report, also include an image that will go just after your blockquote.
It's up to you whether you want to use an online image or one that is on your local device. (It can also be a gif!)

Try and play around with page alignment and sizes to see what you like best.

-->

<center>

![she knows](image_sample.jpeg){width=800}


</center>

<!--

THE CODE

When creating your own reports, one of the first things you'll want to do is add some code!
You can add a code chuck manually by typing three ` signs followed by the type of code chunk you want, {r}. If you do it manually, remember to close your code chunk, again with three `.
Alternatively, on the top of this window, you should see a green button with a C and a little arrow. When you click on it, it will show you the different kind of code you can work with in your report. Select the code chunk you'd like and you're good to go. 

In the presentation I mentioned the Student annual rerport dataset.
Let's take a look at it.

The chunk of code below is already set up for you. Take a look at it and follow the instructions

-->

```{r load dataset}

# At the beginning of a chunk, you will often see "library(xxxxxx)". It indicates that a package has been loaded. Different packages perform different operations. For example, the package "readr" allows R to read the CSV file into a dataframe.

# We want to call this dataframe "students_performance". 

# Exercise:

# Uncomment the code below and insert the name of the dataframe in the spaces demarcated with XXXX.
# You can run the code chunk to see if it works and have a look at the output without knitting the whole document. Once you have added the dataframe name to the code, click on the little green arrow on the top right of the code block, try and see what happens. 

library(knitr)
library(readr)

students_performance <- read_csv("rmarkdown_intro_data/StudentsPerformance.csv")

```


<!-- 

Now you should see a dataframe in your Environment. Click on it to visualize it entirely, or write `View(students_performance)` in the console.


-------------------------------

INCLUDING PLOTS

One important feature of RMarkdown is how easily you can embed plots in your report.

The code to create a plot is ready for you in the chunk below (you will learn more about tidyverse later today) but it is missing the variables to be plotted.

Before you move on, note that near the "r" at the top of your chunk indicating the code type, you can add 
- a name for the chunk (this can be useful to move quickly between chunks by clicking at the bottom left button of this widows, which should feature the heading of your choice)
- the parameters for the chunk:
    - whether you want it to be executed (eval=)
    - whether you want it to be included or excluded in the final output (include=)
    - whether you want it to be printed it or you only want the code output (echo=)
    - whether you want the messages or warnings related to the code (message=  , warning=)

Try and play around with these!

Exercise:

1) Uncomment the code

2) insert a heading before the code chunk and write down a short summary of what it shows just before the plot. also remember to name the chunk. Knit and see how it looks.

3) create another chunk after this one, and use the same formula to create a plot with different variables. (have a look at the dataframe for inspiration). Also here, write down a short description of it before or afterwards, and try to include one word in bold, one in italics and a direct reference to the dataframe (do you remember how?).



ps. if you are using Windows, you can comment and uncomment by selecting and pressing Ctrl+Shift+C
There should be a similar shortcut for Mac. You can find all the shortcuts in Tools > Keyboard Shortcut Help

Male students seem to get higher math scores tha female students.

```{r plot 1, echo=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

students_performance %>%
   ggplot2::ggplot(aes(gender, math_score, fill=gender)) +
   geom_boxplot()

```

```{r plot 2, echo=FALSE}

 library(tidyverse)

 students_performance %>%
   ggplot2::ggplot(aes(gender, reading_score, fill=gender)) +
   geom_boxplot()

```
However, female appear to have higher scores in reading. This seems to support preconceptions about male students typically being educated to choose **scientific subject**, as opposed to female being often directed towards the study of humanities. Hopefully this might change, with educational systems empowering *women in science.*


<!-- Good work!
Now go back to the video: we'll discuss problems and after a short break you'll see how to make tables and manage references.
-->





<!--

Ok, now you are ready for the second practice session.


MANUAL TABLES

As you have seen, you can easily create tables in markdown. One way to do this is to input it manually, using Markdown syntax. This allows you to create a table independently of what is or is not in your environment.
Also, you don't need a code chunk to insert a markdown table.

Markdown tables are physically represented using dash - to separate the header row from the content ones,
and pipe | to separate columns.

heading col 1 | heading col 2
------------- | -------------
Cell          |  Cell  


You can  populate a table in any way you want

Letter | Digit | Character
------ | ------|----------
a      | 4     | $
       | 365   | (
b      |       | ^  

Markdown ignores spacing. The same table could be written like this:

Letter|Digit|Character
---|---|---
a|4|$
 |365|(
b| |^  


NOTE: if you need a void column you must add a space between the pipes



As you can see, the code of the table does not need to represent the spacing of the table - that is accomplished within the markdown.

If you want to align the content of a table, you just have to use the : sign in the separator between the heading and the cell contents as follows:


Lastly, if you want to increase the width of one colum, you can do it "visually", adding or removing dashes.
For example, if we wanted the second colum to be roughly double as wide as the other two, we could do this:


Column | Column         | Column
:----- | :------------: | -----:
Left   | Center         | Right
align  | align          | align


Exercise:

Uncomment the code below and have a look at the dataframe that is created.
Can you reproduce that table manually? Remember that the rules to make text bold and italics work the same as for the text sections.

Create a table manually after the instructions and see if it matches.


-->


```{r}
library(tidyverse)

students_perf_table <- students_performance %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(math_mean = mean(math_score), read_mean = mean(reading_score))

```

gender  |  math_mean |  read_mean
------- | ---------- | ----------
female  |   63.63320 |   72.60811
male    |   68.72822 |   65.47303



<!--

Beautiful. Now see the code below?
That will achieve the same result with the knitr function "kable"

Exercise:

Uncomment the code, find the name of the dataframe we have created above to print the means for math and reading scores, and substitute that to "THE_DATA_YOU_WANT_TO_TRANSFORM" in the kable function. Also, insert the names for columns and give the table a caption.

Knit and see what happens.


-->


```{r}
library(knitr)


kable(students_perf_table, col.names = c("Gender", "Math score", "Reading score"), caption = "Average  amth and reading score by gender")

```





<!--

USING REFERENCES

Remember what we said about references?
first you have to "connect" your reference library to the markdown document.
This can be done by adding a line to your YAML, namely

  bibliography: my_references.bib

if you also want the inline references to connect to the bibliography at the end, add also the following line to the YAML

  link-citations: yes


Open the bib file by clicking at it on your working directory and have a look at it.
Every element in the library starts with a @ sign, followed by the type of work, and then by the reference ID preceded by a { sign.
The ID is what you need to refer to the item.

for instance, the first one in the my_reference.bib file is "Johnson-Laird1989"

Citing this work in your report text is very easy, just use a @ sign, followed by the reference id (no spaces!), i.e. 

  @Johnson-Laird1989

If you want the reference to be within parenthesis, just enclose it in square brakets like this

  [@Johnson-Laird1989]

If you want to add several references within a parenthesis, separate them with a semicolon. Each of the ID has to be preceded by a @.

If they are not in a parenthesis, you don't have to use a semicolon, any separating punctuation should work fine.

  [@Johnson-Laird1989; @Mellmann2017]

  @Johnson-Laird1989, @Mellmann2017

If you need to specify the pages add a square bracket with the page number/s, or with p. and the page number, for the inline references, and {} for the parentheticals.
  
  @Johnson-Laird1989[25], @Mellmann2017[227-234]
  
  [@Johnson-Laird1989{p.23}; @Mellmann2017{227-234}]


Exercise:

Try and write a short sentence where you use one inline reference with a single page number and a reference in parenthesis with a page span.


-->







<!--

Have you noticed how R Markdown automatically creates a bibliography for you?
Give this the heading ## References

Leave this heading always at the bottom of your document, so that the bibliography - that markdown puts at the end - will be directly beneath it.

-->









<!--

Ok, so now you have written down your report and your supervisor tells you he only reads word documents.
Bummer, right?

Well, it is really easy to make her happy.

Just try and add the "word_document" output above "html_document" (at the same indentation).
Remember, if you want a table of content you can add a colon right after word_document, make a new line, indent one more level, and add toc:yes
and the same goes for the section number, number_sections: false

-->
