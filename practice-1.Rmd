# your YAML goes here between the two sets of "---". Erase this line when you are done

It's your turn!

Try and create the header above from scratch. Remember to include the fields `title` `date` `author`, and don't forget the most important one: the `output`!
The YAMS code is sensitive to layout: if you decide to add more details to your output


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown


```{r cars}
library(readr)
StudentsPerformance <- read_csv("StudentsPerformance.csv")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
